# Tattoo Studio Booking Management
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:
Welcome to the repository for the Tattoo Studio website. The goal of this project is to create a website to help managing and promoting a tattoo studio.
It includes a comprehensive website with a user-friendly interface, an admin panel for managing the site, and features such as appointment booking and online payments.
Since the actual size of this project is quite big, I have implemented the basic pages, functions and routes to get a first mock-up. Further functions will be added during the completion
of CS50â€™s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript.

## Architecture

### Global structure

The showcase website and admin panel both originate from the same root file: app.py.
By leveraging Flask, we create distinct routes to handle different sections of the site, ensuring a seamless navigation experience.
This centralized approach not only simplifies the architecture but also allows for a single database connection, enhancing data management and integration.

### The showcase website

The showcase website is a x pages site designed to present the tattoo studio and art to the clients.
2 goals : on one hand, it is a great way to present the tattoo artist, their style and works. On the other hand, it allows the potential client to contact the studio with a detailed form of their personal project.
Thus, we have the following features :
- **Homepage**: A welcoming page with information about the studio.
- **Studio**: Detailed information about the studio.
- **Artists**: Detailed information about the artists.
- **Portfolio**: Gallery showcasing previous tattoo work.
- **FAQ**: Answers about frequently asked questions.
- **Infos**: Information about incoming guest.
- **Booking**: Contact form for inquiries.


### The admin interface
The admin interface access is limited to the studio staff. This interface allows the user to manage the showcase site parameters as well as the artist planning and bookings. The features of the website are divided into three main categories : site management, studio management and personal management.

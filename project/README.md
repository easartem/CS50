# Tattoo Studio Booking Management
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:
Welcome to the repository for the Tattoo Studio website. The goal of this project is to create a website to help managing and promoting a tattoo studio.
It includes a comprehensive website with a user-friendly interface, an admin panel for managing the site, and features such as appointment booking and online payments.
Since the actual size of this project is quite big, I have implemented the basic pages, functions and routes to get a first mock-up. Further functions will be added during the completion
of CS50â€™s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript.

first I checked that it corresponds to 100 songs with the following query :
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM songs;

After checking, valence represents the positiveness of a song.

SELECT AVG(energy), AVG(valence), AVG(danceability) FROM songs;
       0.65906      0.484443      0.71646

 six mood descriptor categories (including “happy,” “calm,” and “hopeful,”)
we assigned a weight percentage to the two audio “moods” that best represent your listening,
and the final product is a swirling gradient of color.

the strongest value on average is the danceability, then the energy adn finally the valence.
Thus the first mood that best represent this person must be orange or

definitely not green

Purple: This aura color pairs well with passionate music listeners. Purple auras tune in to get amped up, entertained, and moving while they navigate the twists and turns of their day.
Pink: Often described as the hopeless romantics of the aura spectrum, pinks view the world with a sense of optimistic, childlike wonder.
Orange: Oranges are the rebellious and bold type. They share a need for high-energy, confidence-boosting sounds.
Yellow: Yellows like their music to align them to the goals of their day, fueling their need for focus, motivation, and self improvement all while reducing any nerves that could get in the way.
Blue: Blues are wistful or emotional, and this hue reflects listeners who seek out music to feel their feelings out loud.

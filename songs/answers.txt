QUESTION 1 : If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?



first I checked that it corresponds to 100 songs with the following query :
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM songs;

After checking, valence represents the positiveness of a song.

SELECT AVG(energy), AVG(valence), AVG(danceability) FROM songs;
       0.65906      0.484443      0.71646

 six mood descriptor categories (including “happy,” “calm,” and “hopeful,”)
we assigned a weight percentage to the two audio “moods” that best represent your listening,
and the final product is a swirling gradient of color.

the strongest value on average is the danceability, then the energy adn finally the valence.
Thus the first mood that best represent this person must be purple or
The second mood could be many different things as we do not look at diverse information.
It could be pink

furthermore the use of spotify made by the user may make the choice vary. For example, one can use it exclusively for partying or driving.
also the average is not very representative
the preference of a person can change depending on their mood and what they are going through in life.

QUESTION 2 : Hypothesize about why the way you’ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

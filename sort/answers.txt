we have three methods and 4 variables :
- random order
- reversed order
- sorted order
- size of the sample (5k, 10k, 50k)
Without running the test files, we can already make assumptions.
selection sort should take the longest in any given situations.
bubble sort can be the fastest for small sample and sorted sample
